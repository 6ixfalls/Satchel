Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RyanLua/Satchel#coc-ov-file) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

When you contribute, you become a project contributor and both are shown on [our repository](https://github.com/RyanLua/Satchel), [contributors graph](https://github.com/RyanLua/Satchel/graphs/contributors), and [your contribution activity](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#contribution-activity).

## GitHub Codespaces

We are fully integrated with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces). When you create a codespace on our repository, all required extensions and dependencies are automatically installed to make contributing easier. The following will be automatically available:

* [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) sync (If editing in Visual Studio Code from your local desktop client. Requires [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/) with the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension)
* [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), [Selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene), and [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) Extensions
* [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally/) packages

Additionally, our codespaces are preconfigured with [pre-builds](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds) and [dev containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers).

## Coding Style

If you plan to contribute, ensure that all code written in Lua follows the [Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/) when applicable.

Also, make sure that your code is properly styled and linted using [Selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene) and [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua).
