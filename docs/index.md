Satchel is a modern open-source alternative to Roblox's default backpack.

Satchel aims to be more customizable and easier to use than the default backpack while still having a "vanilla" feel. Installation of Satchel is as simple as dropping the module into your game and setting up a few properties if you like to customize it. It has a familiar feel and structure as to the default backpack for ease of use for both developers and players.

This documentation will allow you to install Satchel and learn about how to script using Satchel.
