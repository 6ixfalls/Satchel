> Satchel, a modern open-source alternative to Roblox's default backpack.

## About

Satchel is a modern open-source alternative to Roblox's default backpack. Satchel aims to be more customizable and easier to use than the default backpack while still having a "vanilla" feel.

It has a familiar feel and structure as to the default backpack for ease of use for both developers and players.
